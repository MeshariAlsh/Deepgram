# Deepgram - Instagram Bot with Deepseek Chat API

This project automates the process of reading Instagram DMs and generating human-like responses using the Deepseek Chat API. It is also a post scheduler for pre-made content. 
## Features

- **Instagram DM Processing:**  
  Reads unread DMs from both the regular and pending inbox.
  
- **Deepseek Chat Integration:**  
  Uses Deepseek Chat API to generate human-like responses based on incoming DM content.
  
- **Photo Posting:**  
  Uploads photos with captions to Instagram.
  
- **Logging & Error Handling:**  
  Detailed logging and try/except blocks to help diagnose issues and improve robustness.
  
- **Environment-based Configuration:**  
  Sensitive information like API keys and login credentials are loaded from environment variables.

## Project Structure

- **automate_page.py:**  
  Main entry point for the project. Handles Instagram login, sets delays to mimic human behavior, and triggers DM processing.

- **message_handler.py:**  
  Contains functions for saving, loading, and processing DM threads. It also calls the Deepseek API module to generate responses.

- **deepseek_api.py:**  
  Integrates with the Deepseek Chat API to generate responses for incoming messages. Includes logic to ignore trivial messages. Sends responses to other parties.

- **posting.py:**  
  A content management system that handles Instagram post scheduling, prevents duplicate posts, and manages image uploads with captions

## Prerequisites

## Roadmap and Future Features

- **Flagging Important Messages:**  
  A function to mark important messages so that they are not missed by being auto-replied to.
